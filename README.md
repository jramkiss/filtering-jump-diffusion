# Bayesian Filtering for Jump Diffusions

This repo contains code for our final project for Stat 906, which is based off of the paper, [Bayesian Filtering for Jump-Diffusions With Application to Stochastic Volatility](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07137). Our implementations use [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [pfjax](https://pfjax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which both need to be installed. 

The notebook `BayesianFiltering.ipynb` gives a clean overview of our experiments.
